Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session

Prerequisites
-------------

Two subjects in [Literature](/courses/literature) or [History](/courses/history).

Description
-----------

Although this class starts by critically examining the term “ethnic” as it defines a wide range of cultural forms over time, we will focus mostly on contemporary writers. Questions to consider will include: How has ethnic writing changed American culture and renovated forms of literary expression? What are the varieties and nuances of what we might call an ethnic subjectivity? What could it mean to harbor fugitives within the self: transgressive thoughts or a “foreign” identity? And what is the future of “ethnic” literature in a global space?

This seminar will address a number of authors: Dion Boucicault, Sandra Cisneros, Samuel Delany, Junot Díaz, Louise Erdrich, Mohsin Hamid, Mia Heavener, Brendan Jacob Jenkins, Mohja Kahf, Jhumpa Lahiri, Toni Morrison, Ruth Ozeki, and Art Spiegelman. Students will also have a chance to take advantage of the [MELUS](http://www.melus.org/about/) (Multi-Ethnic Literature of the United States) conference, sponsored by the Literature Section in April, 2017, which will bring writers and scholars of ethnic literature to MIT.
