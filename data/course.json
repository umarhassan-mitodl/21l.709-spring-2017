Questions to consider will include: How has ethnic writing changed American culture and renovated forms of literary expression? What are the varieties and nuances of what we might call an ethnic subjectivity? What could it mean to harbor fugitives within the self: transgressive thoughts or a \u201cforeign\u201d identity? And what is the future of \u201cethnic\u201d literature in a global space?\n",
